# ðŸš€ Kubernetes Advanced Topics

Advanced concepts to extend and optimize Kubernetes clusters.

---

## 1. Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

- CRDs allow you to define custom Kubernetes API objects.
- Extend Kubernetes without modifying core code.
- Common for Operators and custom controllers.

Example CRD snippet:

```yaml
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
metadata:
  name: databases.mycompany.com
spec:
  group: mycompany.com
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
    plural: databases
    singular: database
    kind: Database
    shortNames:
    - db

2. Operators
Kubernetes controllers with domain-specific knowledge.
Automate deployment and management of complex applications.
Examples: Prometheus Operator, Cert-Manager, OLM (Operator Lifecycle Manager).

3. StatefulSets Deep Dive
Used for stateful applications requiring stable network IDs and persistent storage.

Examples: Databases, Kafka, Elasticsearch.

Manages pod identity and ordered deployment/termination.

4. API Aggregation Layer & Extensions
Allows extension of Kubernetes API with new APIs.

Custom APIs can be served alongside core Kubernetes APIs.

5. Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB)
Ensures minimum number of pods stay available during voluntary disruptions.

Example:
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: myapp-pdb
spec:
  minAvailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp

âœ… Best Practices
Use CRDs and Operators to simplify complex app management.
Use StatefulSets for databases and queues.
Monitor custom resources health regularly.
Follow Kubernetes API versioning for extensions.
